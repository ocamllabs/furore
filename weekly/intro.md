These weekly notes are rough scribings of activities that happen on a weekly
basis. They are intended to be an internal journal for Lab members rather than
something consumed by the outside world.  If you have any queries about the
contents, please contact Gemma Gordon, KC Sivaramakrishnan or Anil Madhavapeddy.
