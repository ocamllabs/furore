* A robust implementation of email (I check with a complete suit test from another implementation in PHP and JavaScript)
* A robust implementation of meta-data of email (the header of email), it's compliant with old and new standard - 822, 2822 and 5322)
* A beginning implementation of multipart email (I implemented Base64 and QuotedPrintable compute for encoded data)
* Implementation of inline encoded data (compliant with the standard 2047)
