* I continue to document MrMime, you can see the documentation at this link: http://oklm-wsh.github.io/MrMime/ (not very exciting)
* I started a new prototype for ocaml-git, the name is sirodepac, you can see the reopository at this link: https://github.com/dinosaure/sirodepac
For the sirodepac, the goal is to created a non-blocking encoder/decoder. So, Thomas follows the project and it's works for the moment despite some little bugs.
