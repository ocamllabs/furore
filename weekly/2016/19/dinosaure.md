* As you know, I released Syndic 1.5 with ptime to compile in MirageOS. Hannes merged this change in Canopy
* I optimized Decompress and I won 4 MB/s in Inflate
* Jeremy Yallop send me a snippet for Decompress to win 2 MB/s (I didn't try this snippet yet but it is my TODO)
* I came back to MrMime and fixed little bug in multipart parsing
* I reorganized MrMime to have a better interface
* I tried to use ocaml-imap to communicate with my GMail and it's work fine
* But I'm focussing on the test of parsing now so I think the next, I will do just a many test to prove the maturity of MrMime (I already started)
* May be I cook some cookies tomorrow for Monday :)
