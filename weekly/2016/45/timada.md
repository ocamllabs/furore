What I have done in the recent weeks is as follows;
 - Finish reading (and testing codes in) Real World OCaml which will be related to my research topic
 - Investigated how MirageOS boots up on Xen by reading the MirageOS and mini-os source codes, and understood how OCaml based modules and the mini-os part in MirageOS interact
 - Started reading papers, documents, and source codes of Netmap and DPDK networking frameworks to consider how I can taking advantages of them in implementing my network acceleration feature on MirageOS
