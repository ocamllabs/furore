1. I realised the first version of Owl to OPAM with the help of others, also included it in the MirageOS documentation.

2. I started shifting more efforts back to the distributed data processing framework. I rewrote the part of the data parallel and model parallel engine and wrapped them into a separate core module. On top of that, I implemented the one stochastic gradient decedent algorithm using model parallel engine.

3. I have been investigating the Latent Dirichelet Analysis model and identified some potential research questions. Me and mort met the student (Ben Caterall) who will work with on his part III project. He will also contribute to Owl.

4. I also implemented a simple LDA model using Owl, I hope Ben and me together can make a topic module for Owl.
