1. I have optimised the performance of sparse complex matrix module. Many operations are much faster than before now. I think this module is mostly done.

2. I have implemented a module for Fast Fourier Transforms with basic operations. I still need some time to finalise this module next week.

3. I start writing up some documents to prepare for an opam release in the following weeks.

4. I start allocating more time on the distributed data processing framework again this week. The progress on this was slow due to the distraction from Owl.
