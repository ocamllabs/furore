* I continue to improve the interface of MrMime
* I succeed to use the interface of david (it's the same of angstorm project) - now, the user can produce its parser
* I find some littles regressions with my big test (my 2000 emails) - I will fix that
* We can use the bigstring instead the string module now (so, possibly, we can improve the performance - but I need some tests about that)
* I continue to documente the project and after we can have a release of MrMime
* For this week, I will work on Decompress (as Richard advise me) about the performance, I already a PoC from zlib so I will test it.
* I think I continue to work the morning on MrMime (because is just some fixes) and after I work on Decompress.
