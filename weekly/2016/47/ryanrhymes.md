1. I kept working on the P2P engine, and I implemented a distributed LDA atop of P2P engine in my data processing framework. I spent about two days in debugging it and finally managed to make it work.

2. I had a meeting with Mort to refine our thinking on the data framework and identified a couple of interesting research questions: barrier control, and model consistency.

3. I had a couple of meetings with those who are interested in owl and identified some potential directions: more advanced support for multi-dimensional array, and auto gradient derivation functions. I will focus on these two and try to get them ready by the end of this year.

4. I wrote a separate post for using owl to manipulate matrices, in case you didnâ€™t notice before, here is the link: https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/wiki/Manipulate-Matrices-in-Owl
