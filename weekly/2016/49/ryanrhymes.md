1. I finished the first version of n-dimensional array in Owl, including some optimisation and the full documentation.

2. I also wrote a tutorial on Ndarray which you can find here: https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/wiki/Tutorial:-N-Dimensional-Array

3. I did some initial comparison to numpy and julia, it looks promising at the moment, and I will do more thorough evaluation next week.

4. I also talked to kc and michel and discussed about further optimisations on owl, I will look into the directions they suggested in the following weeks.
