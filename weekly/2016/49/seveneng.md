- talked with mort about the next project/direction to work on, for now, there are two possibilities: about PIH-store, develop a model-based compression engine inside of it, so that the data could take up much less storage space, yet with tolerant divergence from their real values; another one is about developing some temporal logic(together with buffer management) to extend the expressibility of packet capturing of network traffic

- talked with Magnus about work within MirageOS tcp/ip stack testing, at the moment there are testing about different parts of a protocol (say for TCP, we have tests for options and window management), Magnus is working on more different vnetif backends (to simulate different network traffic failure modes), I think there may be something missing in between, like tests when different parts of a protocol working together as a whole under various scenarios, or a test for layers in the stack working together with different packets traces, there are some parts in test_rfc5961.ml and test_iperf.ml, but I think there should be a easier way to express these and a higher level interface to create packets and traces instead of manually created cstruct(s), I'd like to develop something like `packetdrill', probably together with a test environment and I've already started to look into this.
