- Preparing for the network performance evaluation
  - Implementing an automation framework of the network performance evaluation
    - This will be finished in several days
    - Took long time to solve how to get logs of the MirageOS console (A logging scheme provided by Libvirt could not work, so I investigated and tried other logging frameworks)

- Making a slide deck to introduce my work at OCaml Labs to Hitachi Data systems guys
  - 90% finished
    - I will be able to submit the slide to you for checking next week
    - I will also check what kind of checking process in Hitachi for the slide is needed.
