Sorry for the late email this time, I was travelling on Friday. For the last week, I had been only focusing on the N-dimensional array in Owl.

1. I implemented the first version of N-dimensional array, atop of which, I also implemented a N-dimensional view module which can pipeline some operations on the array to speed up the performance.

2. I later find a better way to further optimise the performance of ndarray by using blas/lapack library. I am currently rewriting some code for better performance.
