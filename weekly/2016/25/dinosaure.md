* I continue to optimize MrMime and I will use the Bigstring (which is more faster than the String module) with my RingBuffer
* I finished to implement the interface (recommended by david) of my parser combinator (it is the same interface as the angstorm library from seliopou but with a different backend - as you know I use a ring-buffer)
* So I continue the large background work on MrMime and keep the stability (and avoid any regression) with my unit tests. So, nothing impressive but needed to concurrent any other implementation of email :)
