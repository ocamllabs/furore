* So I focused this week on my abstract for the ICFP (so Richard corrected the paper and I have sent Friday)
* I continue to implement the pretty-printer of MrMime (I implemented without regresssion with my unit test)
* I start to look S/MIME (secure mail) - so may be I will implement with ocaml-tls the secure mail one time
