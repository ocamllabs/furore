For this week, I have been focusing on the development of the data processing framework. I have done the following things:

1. I implemented a very simple DHT for the framework.

2. I finished the first version of peer-to-peer model parallel engine, on top of which I also implemented a SGD algorithm.

Besides these, not much, the P2P model turned out to be much more complicated than the map reduce and parameter server models. Currently, I am focusing on the barrier control implementation in the framework.
