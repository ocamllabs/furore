This week I split my time under two projects: the continuing of my auto perforator and the datakit project.

The auto perforator is coming along very nicely. There is now a hill climbing algorithm built in which will explore the perforation state space. I have the system working under 3 domains: swaptions, ray tracer, and kmeans. I will give a talk about the system next Tuesday.

The datakit project is under KC's guidance. The idea is to use datakit to power a distributed key-value store. The implementation would be a domain for testing systems which adapt to byzantine errors by changing the strength of their reads into the database.
