* I finally implemented support of static components in coercions. Now, module interfaces can be fully constrained (not only a subset consisting only of runtime values).
* As a necessary condition for that change, the code duplication between `Translmod` and `Translstatic` was reduced to a minimum. Now, all `Translstatic` does is create the necessary lambda code to run splices.
* When trying to use external static code in REPL, I realized that the it couldn't work because of the coexistence of ambiguous identifiers in the symbol table (e.g. `Expr` may be bound to the runtime part of the `Expr` module used in runtime code, or the static part of that module used in static code, a problem that doesn't arise in `ocamlc` since only the static parts are run). I am currently working on adding phase information to the symbol table to resolve these ambiguities.
