I have been working on the following things.

1. I received a lot of feedback of Owl via github and emails from different people. Based on the feedback, I decided to restructure the Owl a bit by providing a more general matrix module using GADT. I already finished the initial version of Dense.Matrix module. In the near future, it will replace the current Dense.Real and Dense.Complex to provide matrix support for more types and precisions.

2. I met Huawei people with Jon and presented Owl and Actor (the data processing system) I developed. They showed some interests which is a good sign (maybe:)

3. For Actor, I have been collecting papers and doing literature survey to formulate the idea.

For next week, I will fly back to Helsinki so I cannot attend the meeting any more this year. I will see you guys next year in January :)
