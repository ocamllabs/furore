- Network performance evaluation
  - Finished it on MirageOS and Linux VMs.
  - Observed network throughput on MirageOS VMs is worse than on Linux VMs. We will need to investigate why this happens.
  - 128-byte buffer size:
    - 3MB/s on MirageOS-Xen, 24MB/s on MirageOS-virtio
    - 46MB/s on Linux-Xen,    38MB/s on Linux-virtio
  - 1024-byte buffer size:
    - 16MB/s on MirageOS-Xen, 38MB/s on MirageOS-virtio
    - 230MB/s on Linux-Xen,   295MB/s on Linux-virtio
- Also preparing for releasing my source codes on the Github.
   - this includes only source code sophistication for releasing, and will be finished in several days.
