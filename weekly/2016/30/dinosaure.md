* I just improved (again!) the interface of MrMime:
  - So the design of the API is approved by Daniel and I wait a feedback of Richard to know if we will release a new version or not
* After, I did go to docker to meet Thomas and prepare a TODO list for ocaml-git. Now, I have a clear idea to what I need to do for this project.

Not a big week so, but a good week to clarify some points about MrMime and ocaml-git.
