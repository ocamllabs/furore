* I continue to work on a prototype of ocaml-git. I just finished the decoder for the IDX file, I will try the implementation next week.
* I continue to document MrMime - Richard showed me some emails when MrMime fails. These emails are wrong and the thing is, if you use MrMime by the best effort way, you can extract all information from the email, so MrMime can parse these email by the hard way - not the simple way.
