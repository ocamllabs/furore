* I finished fixing some bugs with Decompress, so we have a stable version after many optimization. As I explained, we don't have a big improvement on the performance but Jeremy will take the relay
* After Richard focused me on a performance problem in MrMime, so I fixed the bug. It's a technical point bug I wait Richard to launch an other test
* I started a little library to see any differences between an email before and after decoding/encoding, I think, I will finish this mini-project this week-end - and may be it's a useful project for irmin
