* Monday (2016-10-03)  
: With the help of Leo White, I realised that `Int_base` (see prev. worklog)
  should not be set to 0 in the static code. So IÂ just removed the related
  condition in `Translmod`, and this segfault went away. But doing that incurred
  new dependencies from files such as `utils/numbers.ml` to stdlib `cmm` files.
  I moved all `stdlib/*.cmm` files to `boot/` (as was already done with
  `stdlib/*.cmi`) and it seems to do the trick for now.
  Today's issue arose in the following code:
  ```
  (* this introduces a module `T` in scope *)
  include Identifiable.Make (struct (* ... *) end)
  module Pair = Identifiable.Make (Identifiable.Pair (T) (T))
  ```
  Causing a `Bytegen.comp_expr: var T_1712` error.
* Tuesday  
: Removing another `target_phase` condition just made it work. It's quite
  surprising and I am afraid that something might break if I keep applying fixes
  that I don't understand, but I'm too lazy to take it seriously right now.
  But bad news: `ocamldoc/odoc_args.ml` uses first-class modules in way that
  makes the current way of translating modules go wrong:
  ```
  module Html =
    (val
     (
     match !Odoc_args.current_generator with
       None -> (module Odoc_html.Generator : Odoc_html.Html_generator)
     | Some (Odoc_gen.Html m) -> m
     | _ ->
         failwith
           "A non-html generator is already set. Cannot install the Todo-list html generator"
    ) : Odoc_html.Html_generator)
  ;;
  ```
  Simply translating module unpacking (`Tmod_unpack`) fixed that one, but it
  will probably break in certain cases.
  Warning: phase not taken into account when typing recursive modules in
  `Typemod`. (later note: fixed)
* Wednesday  
: Basic examples with static modules work. And even static functors! How amazing
  is that!
  I implemented phase checks for modules, i.e. the compiler raises an error if
  a module identifier of the wrong phase is used in a functor application or a
  binding.
* Thursday  
: Today, I removed all the debug messages printed by the compiler and started to
  write a test suite for macros. For now it only contains very basic checks
  related to static values, quoting, splicing and static modules.
  I also removed the `Translstatic` module, which had become unnecessery, and
  moved its contents to `Translmod`. Doing that enabled me to make the REPL
  compile static modules (prior to that, they were just ignored).
  To-do list for the next days:
  * make `ocamlopt` work again by fixing
    `Translmod.transl_store_implementation`.
  * run all tests on both compilers to see if anything is broken.
  * rebase `macros` on `trunk` (ouuuuch) and run the tests again.
* Friday  
: Remark: one day, I will have to harmonize the behaviour of bytecode and native
  linker. This is not needed for macros to work, but is necessary to have a
  consistent user interface between the two compilers.
  `ocamlopt` compiles again. Testing time!
  A bunch of tests failed this time:

  ```
  Several failures seem due to include path problems, causing `Unbound modules`
  errors.
