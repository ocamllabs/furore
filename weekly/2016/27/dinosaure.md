* I defunctorized Decompress, so the API is more simply and I won 2 Mb/s for the inflate but I losted 2 Mb/s for the deflate
* Now Decompress uses memcpy function instead memmove (standard function used by OCaml), it's a technical aspect but a big technical point about the portability on Decompress (on Xen architecture specifically). So, I talk about that with Jeremy and we think we have no problem and may be it's a good change to improve the performance of Decompress
* I used a project from LexiFy, landmarks (Thomas advised me to use that), and Spacetime from Mark to find the bottleneck in Decompress and I found this Friday. I have an idea to optimize Decompress (again and again) but I think, we found the the big problem about the performance in Decompress (and it converges with Jeremy's idea)
