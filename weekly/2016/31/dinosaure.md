* I talked with Christophe about the optimization, I have not yet advised Jeremy about the benchmark but I keep this thing when Jeremy will try to optimize Decompress
* I move Decompress to topkg because Anil wanted a Dockerfile inside the project
* Richard retested MrMime and I fixed some bugs and optimized some computations. Now, we compute 180 mails per second and MrMime fails on 500 emails with 815 000 emails! So it's not bad, we will fix the rest with Richard when he comes back
* I fixed a little bug for Qi Li on the Xen librairies
* I continue to document MrMime
* And I looked inside ocaml-git to understand where I need to start but I does not do revelant something for the moment.
