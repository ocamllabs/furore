- The operators are re-designed last week with some newly added ones. The Ext module is also finished. I then released the version 0.2.4 on OPAM.
- The work on neural network module continues, at the same time I add more functions into Owl's core.
- I wrote two tutorials: one is on [operators and ext module](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/wiki/Tutorial:-Operators-and-Ext-Module); one is on [algorithmic differentiation](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/wiki/Tutorial:-Algorithmic-Differentiation).
