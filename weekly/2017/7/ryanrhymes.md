- I added several more functions into Owl module such as tile, repeat, and etc.
- I added matrix type into current AD forward mode to support simple linear algebra.
- I started to re-design another AD module in order to have better supports for both forward and backward AD (to be implemented). Moreover, in new AD implementation, I change from recursive modules to a chain of recursive functions.
