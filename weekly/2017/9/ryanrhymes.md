- We finalised the paper on privacy-preserving model training paper and submitted to PoPETs.
- I worked with Jianxin to installed Owl on Raspberry PI and did some topic modelling experiment. There is an ARM-based docker image for Owl now.
- I spent a couple of days in studying the software licensing stuff and made a new plan for Owl development. I will gradually remove the dependency on GSL to make sure Owl will remain MIT licence.
- I start building an extension atop of Owl so that different types of math objects (scalar, matrix, ndarray) can interoperate.
