  mantis: https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=7456
- Planning for DaLi research paper. tl;dr is to add language level support
  for mergeable datatypes. This builds on several pieces of work that has
  already been done:
  - [ezirmin](https://github.com/kayceesrk/ezirmin)
  - [Cuekeeper](roscidus.com/blog/blog/2015/04/28/cuekeeper-gitting-things-done-in-the-browser/)
  - [diff-datatypes](https://github.com/gprano/diff-datatypes)
