- Set up a blog hosted on github pages. I plan to do a few posts about my attempts
  at typing and/or verifying the CPS translation
- Made some progress on the Agda formalization of a lambda calculus with simple effects
  - The syntax and types are done
  - The small step semantics using substitution is almost done
  - The abstract machine needs some work
