- I had been working on interfacing to CBLAS and LAPACKE last week. I wrote a parser to generate the interface automatically from cblas.h and lapacked.h. I also used Ctypes but the giant "foreign" function makes compilation extremely slow. I tried a couple of solutions then ended up using the c_stub code generated by ctypes but generate ocaml_stub myself in the parser. The parser also generates mli file to make sure the type signature is correct. This solution achieves both the strictness on type and efficiency on compiling.
- Currently, Owl implements a full interface to all CBLAS and LAPACKE functions (over a thousand). These code are generated automatically, but I will write high level interface myself later this month.
