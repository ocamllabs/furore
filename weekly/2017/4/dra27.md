(reduced week)

**OCaml 4.05**
- Change Log Processor merge - failed to reach consensus. Shelved for now - will hopefully get turned into a Git merge driver instead.
- Various GPR reviews
- PR#7373, fixing a bug (of my own) in the FlexDLL bootstrap part of the build system. Tacking on some improvements to that which will feed into OPAM.
