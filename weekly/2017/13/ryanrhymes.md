- I made an experimental module called [Owl_ext](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl/tree/master/lib/ext) which allows interoperation of different number types. This should make analytical app easier to write and the code should be more concise. I finished the first version and here is an [example](https://gist.github.com/ryanrhymes/f9cce1afcd06a5f4683aae45be01bdbe). **Please do let me know if you have any comments on the design.**
- I made several c functions in Owl to cast bigarray between different number types. These functions serve Owl_ext module for converting number types whenever necessary during interoperation.
- I start building neural network module atop of current Owl's functionality and AD module. I think Owl's future development should be motivated by the realistic applications. I will start looking into various application scenarios and neural network seems a good starting point.
- I start working on the actor system and barrier control again, pushing forward the experiment to get more results out.
