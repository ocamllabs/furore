- Windows testing of 4.04.1/4.05.0 revealed a few issues with the CI (GPR#1115, GPR#1116)
- AppVeyor testing is sooo slow - GPR#1116 in particular took ages to prepare waiting for CI results!
- Supporting build system changes across 4.04 and 4.05 is also proving slow work (GPR#1101 / GPR#1023) but at least that's only for this release cycle!
