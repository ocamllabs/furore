    1. a pair of receiver and sender unikernels on a host physical server
    2. multiple pairs of the unikernels on a host physical server
    3. multiple pairs of the unikernels on two different physical servers(multiple sender unikernels on a physical server, and multiple receiver unikernels on the other physical server)
