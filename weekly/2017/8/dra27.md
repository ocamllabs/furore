** OCaml 4.05 **
- Cygwin-32 fork issue ongoing - identified that the problem is DLL load order, but
  not yet clear why this only affects Cygwin-32 or what the fix should be.
- OCaml Developers' Meeting - a number of old GPRs discussed and triaged. Plea from
  Xavier that each dev triage, and preferably resolve, 5 Mantis PRs pcm.
