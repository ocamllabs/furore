- Started writing on the work I've done so far
- Finished setting up the blog after some troubles with mathjax over https
- Little progress on the Agda developments. Since we still don't have a typed cps translation I'm going to spend less time on this.
- The plan for next week is to have a summary our attempts at "verifying" the cps translation either through a type system or a proof that it preserves semantics.
  Then we can start asking for outside feedback and see what we can do.
