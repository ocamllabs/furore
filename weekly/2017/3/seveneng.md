- Read literatures about model-based data compression. Found two algorights that might be apt to integrate into pih-store, Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation and Slider Filter. They are both online processing algorights. The idea is to cut the stream of data into appropriate segments, and fit the data in each segment to a specific linear function. Next week, may try to implement the first version of this.

- Continued learning about the design and structure of `packetdrill`. Still not clear about what shoud the statck test framwork should look like.

- Browsed some repos that use `topkg` from [doc page](http://erratique.ch/software/topkg/doc/Topkg.html#menagerie), finished learning how to use it.
